    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom buns. Add lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments as desired. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite side dishes.</li>
